![home-page-banner1](C:\Users\mgisi\Sync\Mark\mgisi\dev\boundless\docs\images\home-page-banner1.png)

Empower all employees to be creative, to  innovate - by  tracking, fostering and recognizing their suggestions for new product features, tools, customer demos, open source projects or fun maker projects. It is great for fostering innovation,  supporting a 24/7 hack-a-thon.

Humans are empowered when given the chance to share their ideas and innovations. The ***Boundless Ideas*** program builds on the principles that drive innovation in open source communities. The approach is simple:

- Anyone can propose an idea (scratch an itch - as they say in the open source world)

- Others can easily browse, view and support those ideas (visibility)

- Ideas are tracked through three stages: 

  ​		i) Idea

  ​		ii) Proof of Concept (PoC)

  ​		iii) Impact

- Where recognition is easy to achieve even when juggling 100s (if not 1000s) of ideas and innovation proposals.   

This repository contains the code of a web portal that greatly facilitates the fostering and development of ideas. It enables organizations to to track develop and realize the impact of the ideas within a community or company.
